# components
components are the building blocks of the UI. A component is a reusable, self-contained piece of code that defines how a part of the user interface (UI) should look and behave.

# Types of Components in React
1. Functional Components (Preferred)
2. Class Components 

# Functional Components
Written as JavaScript functions.
Use hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) for state and side effects.
More concise and easy to read.
Ex: 
    function Greeting() {
        return <h1>Hello This Functional component</h1>;
    }
