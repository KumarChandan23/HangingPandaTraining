# components
components are the building blocks of the UI. A component is a reusable, self-contained piece of code that defines how a part of the user interface (UI) should look and behave.

# Types of Components in React
1. Functional Components (Preferred)
2. Class Components 

# Functional Components
Written as JavaScript functions.
Use hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) for state and side effects.
More concise and easy to read.
Ex: 
    function Greeting() {
        const greet = "Hello"
        return <h1>{greet} This Functional component</h1>;
    }

# class base component 
a class based component is a react component
it used ES6 class syntax
it need render method
it manages state using this.state
it updates state using this.setState()
it uses lifecycle methods 
like componentDidMount(), componentWillUpdate(), componentWillUnmount()
Syntax: 
import React , {Component} from 'react'

class compoName extends Component{
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            greet : "Hello"
        }
    }
    render(){
        return(
            <h1> {this.state.greet} This is class based component </h1>
        )
    }
}

# Props 
props are the way to pass data form one component to other component.
props are the read-only data. it can not be modified by the receiver.
Example: 
import React from 'react';

const Welcome = (props) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
};

export default Welcome;

# Conditional Rendering
conditional rendering means displaying differenct component or user interfase on certain condition
in rect we can achieve it using
1. if else 
    (isLoggedIn){
        console.log("Yes you are allowed ot see details")
    }else{
        console.log("Yoy are not allowed to see detials, Please login first")
    }
2. Ternary Operator
    {idLoggedIn ? console.log("Yes you are allowed ot see details") : console.log("Yoy are not allowed to see detials, Please login first")}
3. Logincal End
    {isLoggedIn && (console.log("Yes you are allowed ot see details"))}
4. switch case 
   const day = "Monday";
    switch (day) {
    case "Monday":
        console.log("Start of the work week!");
        break;
    case "Friday":
        console.log("Weekend is near!");
        break;
    case "Saturday":
    case "Sunday":
        console.log("It's the weekend!");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Just another day!");
    }

# Composition
composition is pattern in react where we combine multiple components to build reusable, flexible UI Structure instead of relaying on inheritance
âœ… why use composition
1. To make code moduler and reusable
2. Encourages separation of concerns
3. improves maintainability
4. using composition we can create models sidebase and more..
